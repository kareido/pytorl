### Examples of Different Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

#### [CURRENTLY UNDER PROGRESS]  

&nbsp;  

**Simple Description:**
<pre> These folders contains RL training scripts implemented using pytorl 
package, showing how this toolbox can be used to tackle different problems. </pre>

&nbsp;  

**Implementation List:**
> - [x] DQN
> - [x] Double DQN (in deep_q_learning folder)
> - [x] Prioritized DQN
> - [x] Dueling DQN (in prioritized_DQN folder)
> - [x] Gorila DQN (i.e. distributed DQN)
> - [ ] A2C
> - [ ] A3C
> - [ ] TRPO
> - [ ] PPO1
> - [ ] PPO2
> - [ ] ...
> - [ ] ...

**Note**
<pre> You may be noticed that there could be much code redundancy in those examples, 
which seems to be inefficient and unnecessary. In reality, it is designed to be 
that since I believe redundancy sometimes is better than over modulized impleme-
tation.</pre>
