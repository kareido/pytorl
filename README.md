## PyToRL: PyTorch Toolbox for Reinforcement Learning
### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[PROJECT CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT]

&nbsp;  

This project is intended to be a RL toolbox for pytorch and contains RL algorithm implementations using  
this pytorl toolbox. As I am currently learning RL, I am going to update this project with many other  
agents and algorithms soon.

&nbsp;  

**current environment used for developing:**
> gym == 0.10.11 with atari 
> numpy == 1.14.3  
> python == 3.6.5  
> pytorch == 1.0.1  
> tensorboardX == 1.2  

&nbsp;  

**run the example code via run_project script:**
```bash
# scripts are located in examples/<project name>/run_project/ folder
sh <script file> 
```

&nbsp;  

**quick example to run the project from scratch:**
```bash
git clone http://gitlab.sz.sensetime.com/huangzhe/TORCH_RL.git
cd examples/deep_q_learning/run_project
sh ATARI_RUN.sh
```
